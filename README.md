Maze game. Imports map from external textfile.
At the moment the game only fetches a pre-defined map that isn't uplaoded yet. If tested at home, place the map in folder named res, which is in root (parallell with src) and is set as recource folder (in eclipse). Call the map ShiningintheDarkness.txt.
